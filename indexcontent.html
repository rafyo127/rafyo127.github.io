  <H3>Week 12: Progress Report.</H3>
  <p><ol>
   <p><ol>
	<p>For this week’s progress report, I will be making and designing a case for my project. 
	The case will contain a couple of opening. 1 for the air vent, usb ports, power supply 
	vent and a LED opening. I will also be working on the LED lighting up when the camera scans 
	the barcode. This could be easily gone as we have the code for the traffic2B program working 
	from the last couple of weeks.</p>

	<p>As for next week, I should be able to demonstrate the working LED light for the scanner
	and I should also be done making the case for my camera. The only thing I will have to modify 
	for the LED light is going to be turning a red light at a constant time and when the scanner 
	scans successfully, a green light comes on for a couple of seconds and then goes back to red. 
	This will be gone by just modifying the the traffic2B code into 2 programs, one for a red light, 
	one for a green light. And then we can execute these programs in python.</p>
	
	<p>As for the financial status, everything is still the same. And no problems so far.</p>

	<p>For this week’s progress report, I will be designing a case for the camera reader and 
	also will be thinking of making a design for a card holder that will hold the card in 
	place so it can be scanned in a faster way. I will be using openSCAD for designing the 
	object as we learned about it in class.</p>

	<p>Also, I was thinking of making an LED indicator that indicates if the code was scanned. 
	If the code was scanned, it would give a green light, it fails then it would give a red LED 
	light. I will using the PCB that we created in class back in week 7.</p>

  <H3>Week 10: Progress Report.</H3>
  <p><ol>

	<p>In this week’s class, my group and I presented our project demo. For our Humber Parts 
	Crib project, we had to get the barcode scanner to read codes from a barcode strip. We 
	successfully got the barcode to scan barcodes and it also writes it to a file 
	called ‘student_numbers.txt’ in ‘w+’ mode. I used ‘w+’ mode for only testing purposes, 
	it overrides the file every time it scans a barcode and that’s not what we want for our 
	project, we want it as appending to the next student number then we’d have to send that 
	number to database where it will be handled. </p>

	<p>For the next step in our project, we will be working on the efficiency of the project. 
	Our camera’s were not the best therefor they were very slow on scanning the student numbers, 
	we had to hold the card in one place so it could recognize it. For a temporary fix, we could 
	use a card stand for making the camera scan in a faster way. (We can do this by (making a 
	3D printed case)(Idea from Professor Kristian.) But for the long run, we’d have to use a laser 
	barcode scanner. It would be great if we’re about to borrow one from Humber as this project is 
	based on Humber’s parts crib.</p>

  <H3>Week 6: Project Assembly</H3>
  <p><ol>
   <li>Over View</li>
   <p>For this week, I had my project fully assembled and ready to go. 
	   I also managed to ge the camera to recognize barcodes and 
	   printthem out on the terminal. I also soldered my PCB 
	   board, it just needs to be tested for next week.</p>
	 
	 
	   <p>The problem i had with the barcode program was that it kept freezing 
	   while scanning the barcodes sometimes. And it also did not recognize 
	   the barcodes that i customized, it only recgonized numbers as the barcode. 
	   A solution to this problem is to either change our barcode style or update the
	   python program to read letters and number intead of just numbers. The language 
	   i used to program was Python although it can be done with C. </p>
	 <p></p>
	   <p>As for the next step, I need to test my PCB for shorts so that i could connect it
	   and test it on my raspberry pI.
	 </p>
	 <p></p>
	 <p>Financial updates:</p>
	 <p>Everything is on schedule for the project as of right now, my total was about $140 
	    for both the raspberry pi kit and the camera and also the printed barcode strips.</p>
